# GDB's Open Community Project

Welcome reader! Game Devs Basement is a discord server dedicated to Game Dev and Fun! 
This community project is all about bringing the GDB community together 
while learning and developing valuable skills such as team collaboration.

This is the first community project that we are organizing and this will be the

discuss your ideas, contribute and learn.
