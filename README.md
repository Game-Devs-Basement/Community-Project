# GDB's Open Community Project

Welcome reader! Game Devs Basement is a discord server dedicated to Game Dev and Fun! 
This community project is all about bringing the GDB community together 
while learning and developing valuable skills such as team collaboration.

This is the first community project that we are organizing and this will be the 
repository for it. We are making a 2D game using the Unity game engine. Here you can 
discuss your ideas, contribute and learn.

## How to get involved

To be able to actively take part in this project you will need to be a member of the 
[Game Devs Basement](https://discord.com/invite/3dhbA7HZQS) discord server - as that 
will be the place where important decisions and information about the project will be announced. 

Also you will need follow the roadmap of this project at [codecks](https://open.codecks.io/gdb)
to choose how and what you want to contribute to the project. Codecks will be the project 
management tool, so be sure to keep up with it. 

You can also discuss here on github - in the [Discussions](https://github.com/Game-Devs-Basement/Community-Project/discussions) 
tab - for including any new feature, reporting bugs, or for just asking and answering questions about the project.
